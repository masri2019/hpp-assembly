## Human Pan-Genome project and Hifiasm 

This repository contains the workflow, Dockerfile and some test json files to run [hifiasm](https://github.com/chhylp123/hifiasm), a haplotype-resolved de novo assembler for PacBio Hifi reads. The workflow is going to be used in generating the inital assemblies of the samples sequenced by [Human Pan-Genome Project](https://humanpangenome.org/).
